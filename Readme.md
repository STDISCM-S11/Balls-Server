STDISCM Problem Set # 3

Authors: Janine Chua Ching, Ayisha Dytoc, Faith Griffin, and Tyrone Sta. Maria

This project is a particle simulator that utilizes concurrent programming alongside Java and JavaFX.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Visual Studio Code: An open-source editor by Microsoft that supports a variety of programming languages including Java. Download and install Visual Studio Code from [the official Microsoft website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 Corretto: Amazon's distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) which provides a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). Download JDK 21 Corretto from [Amazon Corretto's official website](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) and install it.
- Java Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code: This extension pack includes essential Java development tools such as Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat, Debugger for Java, Java Test Runner, Maven for Java, Java Dependency Viewer, and Visual Studio IntelliCode. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar, or press Ctrl+Shift+X. Search for "Java Extension Pack" and install it.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal in VS Code (you can do this by going to Terminal > New Terminal from the menu, or using the shortcut Ctrl+).
```
git clone https://github.com/STDISCM-S11/Balls-Server/tree/main
```
or download as a ZIP file and extract it

## Step 2: Open the Project

Using Visual Studio Code

Go to File > Open Folder and select the cloned directory.

## Step 3: Configure Java Environment

1. Once the project is loaded, VS Code may automatically detect and prompt you to select a Java environment. If it does, select the JDK 21 Corretto installation.
2. If VS Code does not prompt you, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type "Java: Configure Java Runtime", and select it. Then, follow the instructions to select JDK 21 Corretto as your JDK.

## Step 4: Build and Run

1. Navigate to the src folder in the Explorer pane of VS Code. Right-click on the main.java Java file and select "Run Java".
2. Alternatively, you can use the terminal within VS Code to compile and run your Java application using the javac and java commands, respectively. Ensure your terminal's current directory is the project root.

## How to Use the program

Here is a demonstration of how to use the particle simulator.
